# Leaf Disease Detection Using SVM Classifier

## Objective
The aim of this project is to develop a system for detecting paddy leaf diseases from images. This involves identifying the diseased portions of the leaves, extracting relevant features, and utilizing SVM classifier for recognition.

## Proposed System
### Motivation
The primary motivation behind this project is to alleviate the challenges faced by farmers in the agricultural sector, particularly in paddy cultivation, by providing an automated solution for disease detection and recognition.

### Approach
1. Preprocessing the input image to enhance quality and remove noise.
2. Detecting and extracting features from individual paddy leaves.
3. Utilizing SVM classifier for recognizing the disease portion of the paddy leaf.
